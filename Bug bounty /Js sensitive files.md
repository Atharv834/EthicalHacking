### Js Sensitive Files

```bash
batcat domains.txt | waybackurls | grep '.js' | httpx -mc 200 >> js.txt
```

Use Nuclei tool to find the JS files:

```bash
nuclei -l js.txt -t /nuclei-templates/http/exposures -o potential_secrets.txt
```

Then try .json to find out the info or try out brute forcing below sensitive directory paths.
