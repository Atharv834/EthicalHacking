```apache
AddType application/x-httpd-php .PHP
```

## Explanation:
This directive instructs the Apache web server to treat files with the extension ".PHP" as PHP scripts. As a result, when a client requests a file with the ".PHP" extension, Apache will execute it as a PHP script and process any PHP code contained within it.
